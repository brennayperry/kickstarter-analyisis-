# An Analysis for Kickstarter Campaign
Analysis of Kickstarter data to determine trends
# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
This project was designed to determine what correlations there are between launch dates and campaign goal outcomes. 
Excel is needed to view the charts and other visual aids for this project
### Purpose
The Purpose of this project is to determine trends between launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
To determine a correlation between certain campaign funding goals and launch dates I needed to create new worksheets in order to make data sets that showed more pertinent information , specifically we needed to see the outcomes and funding goals for theater projects. For this analysis I created two new sheets with only the data I needed, the first new sheet provides a more precise look at the trends between launch dates and the campaign outcome. The next step in the analysis was to create another chart to display the  percentages of goals funded and whether the theater projects were successful, cancelled or had failed.  Some challenges encountered with the initial data set were that there was too much information, it includes all categories of projects are listed as well as non crucial information for a specific analysis about outcomes and fundraising goals. In order to perform our analysis we needed to filter this information to provide a clear understanding.    

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From our analysis we can conclude that most successful theater projects occurred in may, there was also the highest number of failed projects in the month of may as seen in the pivot table !{This is an image}(![Pivot Table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89491163/133952964-f9b0f830-60d4-4e24-9176-9e1879aa5ae9.png)). This shows us that most of the theater campaigns launched during the month of May !{This is an image}(![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89491163/133953110-8fb92a8c-b4a8-41a7-a660-97a2c980bcc2.png)). From this we can infer that theater projects are generally successful when launched in the month of may. From this data we can also conclude that there are more successful theater projects launches than there are failures through the whole year. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
After analyzing the correlations between outcomes and goals we discovered that campaign goals that were greater than 50,000 are more likely to be failures than successful projects as shown in this line graph !{This is an image}(![Outcomes_vs_Goal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89491163/133952739-cf29ed5a-f2fd-430c-a44e-074c1e81f912.png)). We can infer that this is because the campaign goal was set too high and not enough funds were pledged. More campaigns were successful with a more conservative pledge goal. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges that could have occurred are missing or incorrect data that could have made it difficult to find accurate information for the project

## Results
The results of our analysis are that the most number of successful theater launches occured in May and that the higher campaign goals had a higher rate of failed projects.
